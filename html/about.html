        <h2 style="color:white">Project Background</h2>
        <p>ClimateThreads was born from the need to connect and empower individuals passionate about climate action. 
            Our platform serves as a bridge between environmental awareness and community engagement, translating complex
             data into accessible, meaningful insights. Developed at the University of Colorado Boulder's ATLAS Institute,
              this project seeks to map air quality inequities in the Denver-Aurora region through an interactive website
               and textile visualization. Air quality significantly impacts public health, with long-term exposure to pollutants 
               such as nitrogen dioxide linked to severe respiratory conditions like pediatric asthma. These risks 
               disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income populations, reflecting deep-rooted environmental
                inequities shaped by racial and socioeconomic factors. In the Denver-Aurora Combined Statistical Area (CSA),
                 which includes Boulder, Denver, and Greeley. By leveraging TEMPO satellite emissions data and demographic 
                 insights from the American Community Survey, ClimateThreads identifies spatial patterns in air pollution 
                 and its relationship to social demographics. Through multimedia and algorithmically designed textiles, 
                 the project transforms data into an accessible, tactile format, fostering emotional engagement and empowering
                  residents, urban planners, and policymakers to advocate for equitable environmental policies.</p>

                <h3>Tactile Textile Representation</h3>
                <p>Create a physical textile-based visualization that transforms complex air quality data into a tangible medium, using algorithmically designed patterns to make invisible disparities visible and tactile. This approach emphasizes anomalies in air quality and fosters emotional engagement.</p>

            <div class="member">
                <h3>Bridging Engagement Across Mediums</h3>
                <p>Design a cohesive experience that integrates digital and physical representations, using a unified color palette, QR codes, and links to connect the textile to the online platform. This approach ensures accessibility for diverse audiences across varying levels of digital literacy and access.</p>
