# Climate Threads

ClimateThreads was born from the need to connect and empower individuals passionate about climate action. Our platform serves as a bridge between environmental awareness and community engagement, translating complex data into accessible, meaningful insights. Developed at the University of Colorado Boulder’s ATLAS Institute, this project seeks to map air quality inequities in the Denver-Aurora region through an interactive website and textile visualization. Air quality significantly impacts public health, with long-term exposure to pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) linked to severe respiratory conditions like pediatric asthma. These risks disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income populations, reflecting deep-rooted environmental inequities shaped by racial and socioeconomic factors. In the Denver-Aurora Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which includes Boulder, Denver, and Greeley, oil drilling and other industrial activities exacerbate regional air pollution, posing heightened risks for both urban and rural residents. By leveraging TEMPO satellite emissions data and demographic insights from the American Community Survey, ClimateThreads identifies spatial patterns in air pollution and its relationship to social demographics. Through multimedia and algorithmically designed textiles, the project transforms data into an accessible, tactile format, fostering emotional engagement and empowering residents, urban planners, and policymakers to advocate for equitable environmental policies.
